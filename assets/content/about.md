# Sebastian Wieland

I'm a web developer, proficient in both backend and frontend development.

## About me

- Programming professionally since 2014
- My heart belongs to Kotlin
- Vim is more than an editor, it's a religion
- Team Tabs! Fuck Spaces! (Only with tabs you can `:set ts=<n>` without having to `gg=G` )
